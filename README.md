# Rcam4

**Rcam4** is a real-time VFX project that utilizes the iPhone LiDAR sensor and Unity VFX Graph.

Rcam4 is composed of two subprojects: **Rcam4Controller** and **Rcam4Visualizer**. The Controller is an iPhone app that captures the scene using the iPhone's camera (color and depth) and transmits it to the Visualizer, which runs on a host machine (PC or Mac). The Visualizer renders the scene with several visual effects.

Rcam3 was featured in [VQ]'s performance at [ASTRA] on 24th Feb., 2025.
